# Flood_Me
<br>
<p>
  Actually I was learning about socket module in python3. That time I wanted to do something which can be useful for somepeople. Thats why I 
  wrote this script and tried to explain also using comment. I am learning from youtube. So, you may find some similarities with others code.
  It will act like a tool. So, if you are going to use this tool. Use with your own risk. I ain't be responsible for anything. Read the
  'Disclaimer' part very carefully. 
</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>You can use this script on your mobile phone.</li>
  <li>To do that must use Termux</li>
  <li>Clone the script</li>
  <li>Run 'python3 flood_me.py'</li>
  <li>Do what ever the script asking for.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Happy Coding!!!</h2>
